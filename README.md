For my Year 3 Semester 2 Application Framework module, I developed a web application using React. The application follows a component-based architecture, enabling efficient data loading within individual components without requiring a full-page refresh. This improves the user experience by ensuring fast and seamless navigation. I also hosted the application online and maintained the source code in a GitHub repository. The GitHub project includes a detailed README file with setup instructions, technologies used, and a brief explanation of the features implemented. This demonstrates my ability to build, document, and deploy a modern single-page application using best practices in frontend development.
